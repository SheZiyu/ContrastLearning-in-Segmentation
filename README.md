# ContrastLearning-in-Segmentation

This is my practice for Grand Challenge AMOS22, about the challenging task multi-organ (15 abdominal organs) segmentation. https://amos22.grand-challenge.org/

The code is derivated from the following paper and GitHub repository:

I extended the 2D network into the 3D network to deal with Overall Survival (OS) classification of patients with Primary Central Neural System Lymphoma (PSNSL) using 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
